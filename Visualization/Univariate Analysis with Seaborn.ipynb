    "You are presumably wondering: \"Yeah, Matplotlib is great, it allows me to customize everything what come to my mind. But is there any other visualization library which is able to conjure up good-looking graph with less code? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ladies and gentlemans, itÂ´s **Seaborn** library which is built in top of the `Matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of Seaborn compound from the ability to create attractive, aesthetically pleasing plots integrating `Pandas DataFrame`s functionalities. Hm, what does it mean? I suppose, you remember how we visualize data using Matplotlib. In order to create plot we always needed to 'extract' a Series of the DataFrame and then we were able to apply some plotting function. Seaborn library is another story, thus it operates on the whole dataset, intelligently use labels of the `DataFrame` and internally performs necessary steps. Seaborn makes creating visualizations very easy and intuitive by using high-level functions. "
