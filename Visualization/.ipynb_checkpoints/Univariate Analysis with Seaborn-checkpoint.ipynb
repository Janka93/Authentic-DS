    "# Univariate Analysis with Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "You are presumably wondering: \"Yeah, Matplotlib is great, it allows me to customize everything what come to my mind. But is there any other visualization library which is able to conjure up good-looking graph with less code? Ladies and gentlemans, itÂ´s Seaborn library. The strength of Seaborn compound from the ability to create attractive, aesthetically pleasing plots integrating `Pandas DataFrame`s functionalities. Hm, what does it mean? I suppose, you remember how we visualize data using Matplotlib. In order to create plot we always needed to 'extract' a Series of the DataFrame and then we were able to apply plotting function. Seaborn library is another story, thus it is able to intelligently use labels of the `DataFrame` in plot. It is built on `Matplotlib` and make creating visualization easy and intuitive by using high-level functions. "
